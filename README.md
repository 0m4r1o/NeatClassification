# NeatClassification
This work explores the application of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) for binary classification tasks, utilizing the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as the fitness function. We implement a NEAT-based classifier and evaluate its performance on a real-world dataset. The results demonstrate the efficacy of NEAT in evolving neural network architectures that achieve high MCC scores, indicating robust classification performance.
